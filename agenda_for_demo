The agenda for Call report EDA demo is as follows:
1. Statistical analysis: i.e. hottest industry groups, busiest banker. 
2. Segmentation and primary key: foundation of training dataset. 
3. WordCloud with custom stop words - full text vs top 3 industry groups: what things were frequently mentioned?
4. Top bigrams and trigrams; Emotion polarities: a potential use case: assume we are a banker. I have 1000 call reports. what didnâ€™t progress well? Do I need to put more attention on it. Do I need to request resource? What did I learn from this experience.  
5. Text clustering and visualization: a reference for defining groups in classification.
