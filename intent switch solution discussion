## form has entity with role

“Actually, book a ticket from Toronto to New York”
{city: toronto, city: new york}

The current code will first write to: 
{departure: toronto, city: toronto, destination: toronto, city: toronto}
then the code will write:
{departure: new york, city: new york, destination: new york, city: new york}


And what if user say:
“actually, book a flight ticket to Vancouver”
How the bot know witch requested_slot to assign the value?

More concretely,
User: book hotel 
Bot: which city 
User: actually, book a flight ticket to Vancouver
Or 
actually, book a flight ticket depart from Banff tonight


hotel_form
Requested_slots
hotel_city
- from_entity: city

flight_ticket_form
Requested_slots
departure:
- from_entity: city role: departure
destination:
- from_entity:city role: destination 


How the bots know which requested_slots in  new intent form to write to when there is no info about role?




## for a regular case
In the current solution, requested_slots between two intents are not used actually. 
For example: expiring_time vs time,
trade_client vs client 
Because the name of requests slots are different between forms, the only useful info is the entities, such as client_id, client_name, and so on. 
List is enough; don’t need a dict.
And the O(n^2) can be reduced to O(n) by fetch the full entity list ahead for comparison.












## There is another scenario: when a form use same entity as source in multiple requested slots. 

restaurant_form:
num_of_people:
- from_entity: number 

hotel_form:
num_of_guest:
- from_entity: number
num_of_bed:
- from_entity: number


User: make a reservation at red lobster 
Bot: for how many people?
User: actually, book hotel for us first. 2 queens bed room. 

How the bots know which requested_slots in  new intent form to write to when the extracted entity is only number and num_of_people?
{num_of_people: 2, number:2}



## Intent form with optional dynamic added entity

User: revenue top 5 from James
Bot: ask for time
User: actually, expiry trades of James

Human_name is not entity of any requested slots in trade form  




To summarize, the examples hit drawbacks of the current solution. It doesn’t work for:
1. Intent form uses entity with roles
2. Intent form uses same entity as source in multiple requested slots. 
3. Intent form with optional dynamic added entity



It literally a bug of rasa:
“Actually, revenue” VS “Actually, revenue for blackrock in 2020”
Cause: The new form is not activated in time.


To work around with it:
1> store the intent
2> undo user utterance
3> active the intent form
4> redo the utterance
